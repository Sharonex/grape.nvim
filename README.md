# grape.nvim üçá

`grape.nvim` is a Neovim plugin that simplifies the functionality of [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)'s live_grep by allowing live grep searches with a fuzzy approach for individual words instead of searching for a whole consecutive string with spaces included.

For example, if my project had the string:
I am a human and everyone should love grapes

Grape will allow you to filter for "i love grape" where's in the default Telescope live_grep you would need to:
* filter for the word "grape"
* press <C-f> to stop live grepping
* add the words I love

Also, Grape comes with some more comfortable default UI settings(which can be disabled), 
which allow seeing the actual text you're searching for and not the file being filtered.

## Features

- Perform fuzzy searches for individual words during live grep using Telescope.
- Improved search experience for finding non-consecutive words in your codebase.
- Nicer default telescope config
